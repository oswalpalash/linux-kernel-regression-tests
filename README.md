## Linux Kernel Regression Tests

The repository contains all `C` reproducers for upstream Linux Kernel crashes that can be used to verify the soundness of the newer kernel builds.

## Automated Testing Infrastructure

Currently the repository contains `C` reproducers and the corresponding compiled binaries.
Shortly the automated daily regression test infrastructure will be put into place for continuous regression testing against the Upstream kernel.
